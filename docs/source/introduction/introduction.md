# What is Kedro?

Kedro is an open-source Python framework for creating reproducible, maintainable and modular data science code. It borrows concepts from software engineering and applies them to machine-learning code; applied concepts include modularity, separation of concerns and versioning. Kedro is hosted by the [LF AI & Data Foundation](https://lfaidata.foundation/).

For the source code, take a look at the [Kedro repository on Github](https://github.com/kedro-org/kedro).

## Learn how to use Kedro

In the next few chapters, you will learn how to [install Kedro](../get_started/prerequisites.md) and set up your own production-ready data pipelines.

Once you are set up, we suggest working through our examples, including:

- A typical "Hello World" example, for an [entry-level description of the main Kedro concepts](../get_started/hello_kedro.md)
- An [introduction to the project template](../get_started/example_project.md) using the Iris dataset
- A more detailed [spaceflights tutorial](../tutorial/tutorial_template.md) to give you hands-on experience

We also recommend the [frequently asked questions](../faq/faq.md) and the [API reference documentation](/kedro.rst) for additional information.

## Assumptions

We have designed the documentation and the [spaceflights tutorial](../tutorial/spaceflights_tutorial.md) for anyone new to Kedro. The more knowledge of Python you have, the easier you will find the learning curve.

.. note::  There are a number of excellent online resources for learning Python, but you should choose those that reference Python 3, as Kedro is built for Python 3.6+. There are many curated lists of online resources, such as the `official Python programming language website <https://www.python.org/>`_ and `this list of free programming books and tutorials <https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books/blob/master/books/free-programming-books-langs.md#python>`_.
