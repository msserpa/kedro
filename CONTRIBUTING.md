|Activity|Description|
|-|-|
|Community Q&A|We encourage you to ask and answer technical questions on [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/kedro-org/kedro/discussions) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/akJDeVaxnB), but the former is often preferable since it will be picked up by search engines.|
|Report a bug|We use [GitHub issues](https://github.com/kedro-org/kedro/issues) to keep track of known bugs. We keep a close eye on them and update them when we have an internal fix in progress. Before you report a new issue, do your best to ensure your problem hasn't already been reported. If it has, just leave a comment on the existing issue, rather than create a new one. <br /> If you have already checked the existing [GitHub issues](https://github.com/kedro-org/kedro/issues) and are still convinced that you have found odd or erroneous behaviour then please file a new one.|
|Propose a new feature|If you have new ideas for Kedro functionality then please open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/kedro-org/kedro/issues) and describe the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.|
|Review pull requests|Check the [Kedro repo to find open pull requests](https://github.com/kedro-org/kedro/pulls) and contribute a review!|
|Contribute a fix or feature|If you're interested in contributing fixes to code or documentation, first read our [guidelines for contributing developers](https://kedro.readthedocs.io/en/stable/14_contribution/02_developer_contributor_guidelines.html) for an explanation of how to get set up and the process you'll follow.  Once you are ready to contribute, a good place to start is to take a look at the `good first issues` and `help wanted issues` on [GitHub](https://github.com/kedro-org/kedro/issues).|

## Join our Technical Steering Committee

Kedro is an incubating project in [LF AI & Data](https://lfaidata.foundation/), a sub-organisation within the Linux
Foundation that focuses on open innovation within the data and AI space. A group of maintainers, known as the Technical Steering Committee (TSC), govern the project. You can read more about the structure of our TSC in our [Technical Charter](./kedro_technical_charter.pdf).

We invite community members to join the TSC and help define the future of the Kedro project. Read the [guidance on becoming a Kedro maintainer](https://kedro.readthedocs.io/en/stable/contribution/technical_steering_committee.html) to understand the process of joining the TSC.
